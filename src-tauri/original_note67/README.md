## Speaker Distinction

Note67 can distinguish between your voice and other meeting participants:

| Source | Speaker Label | How it works |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Microphone | "You" | Your voice via mic input |
| System Audio | "Others" | Meeting participants via system audio capture |

### macOS Requirements
- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Screen Recording permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording)
- Microphone permission

### Windows Requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- Microphone permission
- No additional permissions needed for system audio (WASAPI loopback)

## Echo Handling

When using speakers instead of headphones, your microphone picks up audio from your speakers, causing duplicate transcriptions. Note67 handles this with a multi-layer approach:

**How it works:**
1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** - Mic audio is only transcribed if RMS energy exceeds threshold, filtering silence and ambient noise
2. **Echo Deduplication** - Mic transcripts are compared against a 30-second rolling history of system audio segments
3. **Text Similarity Matching** - If mic text shares 3+ words with overlapping system audio, it's filtered as echo

**For best results:**
- Headphones are still recommended for optimal quality
- Works automatically when system audio capture is enabled

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend | Rust (Tauri v2) |
| State | Zustand |
| Database | SQLite (rusqlite) |
| Transcription | whisper-rs (local Whisper models) |
| AI Summaries | Ollama (local LLMs) |
| System Audio | ScreenCaptureKit (macOS), WASAPI loopback (Windows) |
| Echo Handling | VAD + post-processing deduplication |
